I'm a cybersecurity researcher focused on critical infrastructure and industrial systems. I've worked for Dragos since January of 2020.

I love any technical aspect of cybersecurity, malware analysis and vulnerability research. I've been lucky to work on a variety of different projects, and my experience primarily lies in:

- Vulnerability research and analysis
- Malware analysis & reverse engineering
- Patch and binary diffing for vulnerability discovery
- ICS-specific malware, such as:
  - PIPEDREAM (MOUSEHOLE and LAZYCARGO)
  - Fuxnet
  - ...
- Intelligence report writing
- Conference/webinar speaking

### About This Site

This site was built with Astro JS using the [AstroPaper theme](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper).
Then modified further to suit needs. It's actually great, and can be completed extremely quickly.
