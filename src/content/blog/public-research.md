# Complete listing of public research

## Malware Analysis

Here are malware analysis projects I've worked on as a reverse engineer at Dragos:

- Fuxnet Malware ([whitepaper](https://hub.dragos.com/hubfs/Reports/WP_FUXNET_Final_2_CH.pdf) or [strategic brief](https://hub.dragos.com/hubfs/Reports/Dragos_SB_Intel_Fuxnet_ICSMalware.pdf?hsLang=en))
- [APT Exploits for Rockwell Automation ControlLogix](https://www.dragos.com/blog/mitigating-cves-impacting-rockwell-automation-controllogix-firmware/)
- [COSMICENERGY Analysis](https://hub.dragos.com/hubfs/116-Whitepapers/Dragos_SB_COSMICENERGY_June23_FINAL_WEB.pdf?hsLang=en)
- [Deep Dive into PIPEDREAMs OPC UA Module, MOUSEHOLE](https://www.dragos.com/blog/pipedream-mousehole-opcua-module/)

## Conferences

I've presented at several in person conferences, including:

- Dragos DISC'23: When Pythons Attack: The Hunting and Analysis of ICS-related, Compiled Python Samples
- Dragos DISC'23: PIPEDREAM Analysis
- [Dragos DISC'22: Malware, 0 Days, and PLCs, Oh Boy!](/assets/bszh22-Sam_Hanson-Malware-Zero-Days-and-PLCs-Oh-Boy.pdf)
- BSides:Zurich: PLC Password Cracking Malware

Unfortunately, some of these were private conferences with sensitive information, so I am unable to share the all slides.
